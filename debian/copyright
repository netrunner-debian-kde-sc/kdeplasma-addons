Most applets are under gplv2 or later.
Within the files there is occasionally a lgplv2 or later, but together with gplv2 files,
these all becomes gplv2 or later. Lancelot is almost entirely lgplv2 or later, but at least
one file is gplv2 or later, so most probably, entire lancelot is lgplv2 or later as well.
A few cmake files are mentioning the COPYING-CMAKE-SCRIPTS, originating from kdelibs, 
fullquoted in the end.


The dataengines are all available under the lgplv2 or later

Runners/contact: lgplv2 or later
Runners/converter: gplv2 or later

desktopthemes: gplv2, gplv3 or later. Referencing the default plasma theme which is gplv2 or later.
